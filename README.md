BEFORE RUNNING ANYTHING:
    Note that when entering in a password to login, the cursor will not move. 
        -This is a feature I added in order to provide a more secure login experience.
    Also note: The program should allow for any input at any time as long as the desired option is currently displayed on the screen.


HELPFUL TIPS:
    The best user_id to check for logging in as a user is user 7.
        -This user has the most assessment_results.
        
IMPORTANT:
    -the provided login_info.png file will show you user/managers with the info you'll need to login. 
    I took the screenshot before encrypting these dummy accounts' passwords.

TO BEGIN:

1. Run file 'main_best.py':

    a. This file is the most bug free of my main files.
    
    b. If logging in as a manager, only the options '[1] View Tables' and '[2] Edit Records' work on the main menu.
    
    c. If logging in as a user, all options should work.

2. You can try running 'main_only_loads_users.py' and 'main_latest_trial.py' to see additional work done,
However, they do have bugs.

    a. If logging in as a manager, only the options '[1] View Tables' and '[2] Edit Records' work on the main menu.
    b. If logging in as a user, all options should work.
